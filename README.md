Econometrics project and dissertation for MSc Economics 2020

All of the code is embedded with its output into Jupyter notebooks using the SoS kernel; R and Python analysis is interleaved in the same notebooks.
For the convenience of reviewers, these notebooks have been converted into HTML format, and are included in the release download.

They can also be accessed by using the HTML previewer function of GitHub.
For example, to see the impact of FX fluctuations on the non-PPP-adjusted EI and P_GDP measures, see [https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drakesiard/em-2020/blob/v1.0/analysis/8_FX_impact.html]

The project is organised into the following folders:

`data`: Code for downloading and pre-processing the data from sources, and the downloaded data in CSV format

`analysis`: Code for analysing the data and running econometric models

`tex`: LaTeX document and bibliography files

`tex/plots`: Generated charts and tables to include in the document
