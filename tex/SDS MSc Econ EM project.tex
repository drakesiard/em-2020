\title{\textbf{Does deindustrialization increase or decrease energy intensity?}}
\author{S. Drake Siard}
\date{2020 May 5}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This project aims to apply a previously developed path model, originally applied to Bangladesh, to analyse the direct and indirect impacts of (de-)industrialization and trade openness on energy intensity in the United Kingdom. 
The model is first validated by replicating the results in the original paper, and then applied to more recent data in the UK.

\section{Introduction}
Original paper: \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}

\section{Data}

In order to most closely match \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}, it was necessary to use the April 2018 vintage of the data
\footnote{ISG was revised in the June 2018 vintage, and the ``current" \$US scaler for P\_GDP was rebased in September 2019.}.

For technological innovation (TI) the total number of patent applications was used, again matching \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}.
Patent data was retrieved from the WIPO Statistics Database via the IP Statistics Data Center, \cite{worldintellectualpropertyorganisationWIPOStatisticsDatabase2020}.



\section{Conclusion}
Maybe.
