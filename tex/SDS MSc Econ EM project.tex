\begin{abstract}
This project aims to further develop a published path model, originally applied to Bangladesh, to analyse the direct and indirect impacts of growth, industrialization, technological innovation, and trade openness on energy intensity.
The model is first validated by replicating the results in the original paper; not all findings are confirmed, and some choices regarding model construction and data treatment are re-assessed.
A modified version of the model then applied to more recent data in India and the UK, where the directions of industrialisation and technological innovation differ, to see if the original hypotheses continue to hold.

Programs used: Python (\pkg{statsmodels}, \pkg{scipy}); R (\pkg{lavaan}, \pkg{semTools}); SPSS Amos 23 for replication

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Energy intensity, defined as the demand for energy per unit of output, is a critical measure of economic efficiency; it becomes every more important as the world economy develops and world populations continue to rise.
Decreasing energy intensity is a necessary condition for the developing world's economic growth to continue through this century without overwhelming the world's limited resources, and for the developed world to maintain its quality of life while reducing their environmental impact.
A better understanding of the drivers of energy intensity would thus benefit both the developed and developing worlds.

\cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} cite an extensive literature on energy intensity and its influencing factors, and extract four commonly described determinants of energy intensity: economic growth, industrialization, trade openness, and technological innovation.
Economic growth, in both absolute and per-capita terms, frequently recurs as a forcing factor of energy intensity, as both increased population and production place pressure on limited energy sources.
Industrialisation, while increasing absolute energy consumption, allows mass production and its attendant efficiencies.
Trade openness allows substitution away from energy-intensive inputs as well as a focus on higher-productivity exports. 
Finally, technological development (often spurred by foreign direct investment) allows increases in productivity across all input factors.

These nature of these variables, and the specific economic data series used to represent them, are described in greater detail in \cref{sec:data_sources}.
\cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} also cite a number of models and analyses that attempt to estimate the effect of these variables. 
The authors note that due to the interdependence of these variables there may both direct and indirect effects, and propose four specific hypotheses for the interactions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H.\arabic*}]
\item Industrialisation has positive direct impact on energy intensity.
\item Industrialization has negative indirect impact on energy intensity through technological innovation.
\item Trade openness has negative direct impact on energy intensity.
\item Trade openness has negative indirect impact on energy intensity through economic growth.
\end{enumerate}

\cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} then propose a path model (which they describe as novel) to analyse these effects, and apply it to the specific situation of Bangladesh, 1986-2015.
This model is outlined and the results analysed in \cref{sec:original_model}.
The results of the original analysis are (partially) replicated, but some questions are raised regarding the significance of the results and the goodness of fit.

To answer these questions, \cref{sec:data_analysis} then revisits the original data, noting some characteristics that suggest model misspecification; most worrying is the strong possibility of spurious correlation.
These characteristics are then used to inform alternative transformations and model specifications.
These updated models are then described and evaluated in \cref{sec:revised_model}, and the results are summarised in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Data Sources}\label{sec:data_sources}
Energy intensity (abbreviated EI) is measured as the total primary energy use per unit of output. 
The energy use is aggregated as kilograms of oil equivalent, and the unit of output is measured as (inflation-adjusted) \$US of gross domestic product.
Industrialisation (ISG) is the total value added of industry (mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, water, and gas) as a fraction of the total gross domestic product, and is therefore a unitless ratio (scaled in percent).
The abbreviation ISG is due to the original paper labelling this as ``Industrial Share of Growth"; however, the measure actually used is industrial share of output, not of output growth.
Trade openness (TO) is the total value of imported and exported goods and services as a fraction of total gross domestic product, and is likewise a unitless ratio scaled in percentage terms.
For technological innovation (TI), we follow \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} in using total patent application count: resident patent applications are a measure of domestic innovation, and non-resident patent applications are a measure of technology deemed by foreign entities to be worth the effort of protection in that country, as would be the case with imported technology.
Economic development (P\_GDP) is measured as the per capita gross domestic product, in this case the GDP divided by the mid-year population estimate. 
As with ISG, the variable P\_GDP is a measure of output, not of growth, though this will be addressed further in \cref{sec:data_analysis}. 
All of the above data series are sampled at an annual frequency, with a multi-year reporting lag, and are revised series (not point-in-time).
The precise unit definitions are summarised in the first part of \cref{tab:data_source}, supplementing Table 2 in \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{tabulary}
\caption{Variable names and descriptions}
\label{tab:data_source}
\end{table}

For the replication phase, in order to most closely match \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}, it was necessary\footnote{
ISG was revised in the June 2018 vintage, and the scaling factor for ``current" \$US-denominated values was rebased in September 2019.
} to use the April 2018 vintage of the data from the WDI Database Archives, \cite{theworldbankWDIDatabaseArchives2018}.
The specific energy intensity measure EI is not directly available from the database in those units, but is constructed by taking the primary energy use in kg. of oil equivalent per capita, divided by the (2018 base) \$US GDP per capita.
Additional patent data was retrieved directly from the WIPO Statistics Database via the IP Statistics Data Center, \cite{wipoWIPOStatisticsDatabase2020}, and used to fill in gaps in World Bank data where necessary.

The data is truncated to the date range 1986-2015, resulting in the summary statistics in \cref{tab:original_summary_stats}.
Comparing these with the Table 3 of \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}, there is a very close match, but not an exact one.
Of some concern is the mismatch in the number of samples of EI: the per capita primary energy use measure used that has been to construct EI is absent for the year 2015, both in previous vintages and the current version of the upstream database.
While we can use incomplete data to estimate the model, this inevitably results in an additional difference.

In the original paper, the model is run on the logarithm of the data, with no further transformations. 
This results the variable correlations in \cref{fig:original_summary_corr}; significant correlations (at the 0.01 level) are denoted with an asterisk.
We can compare these results with Table 4 of \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}. 
It is unclear in the original whether the correlations are of the raw or log data), but again, in either case, there is a close match in direction and magnitude on all measures, but not an exact one.

For the model update, data was taken directly from the most recent update of the WDI database, \cite{theworldbankWorldDevelopmentIndicators2019}, and two countries were added for comparison: India (with a relatively constant level of industrialisation over the period) and the United Kingdom (de-industrialising). 
PPP-adjusted measures of energy intensity and per-capita GDP were added, and were denoted EIb and P\_GDPb in the dataset. 
In addition, a more up-to-date alternate energy intensity measure was added from \cite{enerdataGlobalEnergyStatistical2019} and denoted EIc in the dataset, for the countries for which it is available.
These added data series are also described in the second part of \cref{tab:data_source}.

We defer further detailed analysis of the data to \cref{sec:data_analysis}, and use the log-transformed data in the initial replication, following \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}.

\section{Original Model}\label{sec:original_model}
Path models\footnote{ 
Some of this section is a summary of material in \cite{klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016}; the interested reader is directed to the source for more details.
} are a subset of structural equation models that deal only with observed variables (as opposed to hidden, or latent variables), where between the exogenous and final endogenous variables there may be one or more mediating endogenous variables.

In the case of \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}, the dependent variable is energy intensity (EI). The two exogenous independent variables are level of industrialization (ISG) and trade openness (TO), and the two intermediary variables are economic output (P\_GDP) and technological innovation (TI).


In the case of this model, openness to trade and industrialisation are the exogenous variables. 
Openness to trade directly affects energy intensity and economic growth, and economic growth in turn affects energy intensity. 
Industrialisation directly affects  energy intensity and technological innovation, which in turn also affects energy intensity.
This model is represented graphically in \cref{fig:original_model}. 
The parameter naming convention is preserved from the original: that is, $P_{y,x}$ represents the regression coefficient of an endogenous variable $y$ of an exogenous variable $x$.

\label{fig:original_model}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Following Figure 3 in \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}, we simplify the diagram by dropping the variance notation.}

Alternatively, we can represent this model as a system of three linear equations:
\begin{align}
TI &= \alpha_{TI} + P_{TI,ISG} TO + \epsilon_{TI} \label{eq:ti}\\
P\_GDP &= \alpha_{P\_GDP} + P_{P\_GDP,TO} TO + \epsilon_{P\_GDP} \label{eq:pgdp}\\
EI &= \alpha_{EI} + P_{EI,ISG} ISG + P_{EI,TO} TO + P_{EI,TI} TI + P_{EI,P\_GDP} P\_GDP + \epsilon_{EI} \label{eq:ei}
\end{align}

This model is recursive; the disturbance processes of the endogenous variables are assumed to be uncorrelated, and all causal effects are strictly unidirectional (there are no feedback loops).
As the model is recursive, it is possible to consistently estimate it using OLS regression, but here we follow \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} in using maximum likelihood estimation.
It is also over-identified: there are twelve parameters to estimate (three means for the endogenous variables, three variances for the disturbances, and six regression coefficients) and fifteen data points (the sample covariances), leaving three degrees of freedom.
The original paper used SPSS Amos 23; in our case, the model was fitted using an R software package for latent variable modeling called \pkg{lavaan}, \cite{rosseelLavaanPackageStructural2012}, and supplementary analysis was performed using the \pkg{semTools} package, \cite{jorgensenSemToolsUsefulTools2019}.\footnote{
Additional code for generating model predictions and residuals was drawn from user contributions that have not yet been merged with the main \pkg{semTools} codebase.
See \url{https://github.com/simsem/semTools/pull/25} and \url{https://github.com/simsem/semTools/compare/master...drakesiard:residual-predict} for more detail.
}

We estimate the model by imputing missing data with a case-wise (full-information) ML estimation, and report Huber-White (heteroskedasticity-robust) standard errors. 
The complete program output for the model can be found in \cref{sec:program_output}.
The standardised coefficient estimates are given in \cref{tab:original_estimates}; we compare these with Table 3 in \cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019}.
p-values below 0.001 are marked with an asterisk; the $R^{2}$ values for the individual endogenous variables are given only for comparison purposes.
Standard errors are not given in the original, but included here for clarity.

The values for \cref{eq:ti} and \cref{eq:pgdp} match fairly closely, and the significance of the parameters and goodness of fit measure for \cref{eq:ei} match, but the actual estimates of the parameters differ significantly (by approximately 10 standard errors).
To confirm that this was not an issue with the choice of estimation software, the model was also estimated with SPSS Amos 23, with identical results.\footnote{
Output from SPSS Amos 23 is not included in this paper, but is available as described in \cref{sec:data_and_code}.}
Without access to the original data set or regression software options, it is impossible to identify the source of the discrepancy.

From the coefficients in \cref{tab:original_estimates}, we construct the indirect and total effects within the model:
\begin{align}
\overbrace{P^{total}_{EI,ISG}}^\text{total effect} &=  
\overbrace{P_{EI,ISG}}^\text{direct effect} + 
\overbrace{P_{EI,TI} \times P_{TI,ISG}}^\text{indirect effect} \\
P^{total}_{EI,TO} &=  
P_{EI,TO} + 
P_{EI,P\_GDP} \times P_{P\_GDP,TO}
\end{align}
The results are given in \cref{tab:original_path_coeff} and used to assess the four hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H.\arabic*}]
\item Industrialisation has positive direct impact on energy intensity.

The coefficient of this direct effect is $P_{EI,ISG}$, which is indeed estimated to be positive (at 0.122) but the p-value is 0.048, so at the 5\% level we (just) reject the null hypothesis (of industrialisation having no effect).
In the original paper, the significance threshold is not given, but they accept the alternative hypothesis\footnote{
The actual statement is: ``Thus, our first hypothesis is proved." 
} with a p-value of 0.082, so we infer a threshold of 10\% in their case.

\item Industrialization has negative indirect impact on energy intensity through technological innovation.

The coefficient of this indirect effect is estimated to be \emph{positive} (at 0.053), but given the relatively high uncertainty of this estimate our confidence interval includes zero.
The original paper does find a negative coefficient, but of a similar (small) magnitude; without knowing the exact standard errors calculated, we can nonetheless infer that this effect is weak, if present.

\item Trade openness has negative direct impact on energy intensity.

Again, the coefficient of this direct effect is estimated to be \emph{positive} (at 0.076), but the confidence interval includes zero.
The original paper finds a negative coefficient, that is just significant at the 5\% level, but in our regression nearly all of the variance in energy intensity is explained by economic growth, and almost none by trade openness and technological innovation. 

\item Trade openness has negative indirect impact on energy intensity through economic growth.

This coefficient is negative (-1.120) and significant at the 5\% level, so we reject the null hypothesis of no indirect impact, as does the original paper.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent 
Based on the data available and the analysis above, we can only replicate the results regarding two of the four hypotheses: H.1 and H.4.


We now turn our attention to model diagnostics.
\cite{panHowIndustrializationTrade2019} only report goodness-of-fit measures at the single-equation level.
Various fit measures for structural equation models and their acceptable values are discussed in \cite{klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016}, which suggests that, at a minimum, the model $\chi^2$, RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR should be reported; for this analysis, we refer to the cut-off values in \cite{parryFitIndicesCommonly2020}.

The CFI is a goodness-of-fit measure that compares the model fit to a null (independent) model, and the cut-off value for a ``good" fit is $\geq0.90$; we calculate 0.946, suggesting the model fits slightly better than the null model. 
For RMSEA, a badness-of-fit measure, we calculate a value of 0.363, which is well above the cut-off value of 0.08, indicating a significant departure from a close fit.
For the model $\chi^2$ (another badness-of-fit measure), we calculate 14.8, which gives a p-value of $<0.01$, well below the cut-off value of 0.05.
This indicates a large discrepancy between the sample and fitted covariance matrices, but this measure is sensitive to sample size, which at ($n=30$) is at the very lower bound of what might be considered acceptable.
Another measure of this discrepancy is SRMR, which at 0.041 is below the cut-off value of 0.08, indicating that at least by one metric the covariance residuals may not be excessively large; however, with all these results taken together, it is clear that the model fit is not ideal.
As a standardised graphical indication of this problem, the correlation residuals (sorted by size) are plotted in \cref{fig:original_corr_resid}; noting that all the major outliers are associated with the TI variable suggests that further investigation is warranted, and so we revisit the data set to consider any scaling or transformations that may be necessary.

\section{Data Analysis}\label{sec:data_analysis}
For the same set of variables, we update the data set to the most recent vintage of WDI data, from \cite{theworldbankWorldDevelopmentIndicators2019}.
We also expand the data set to include India, a comparable developing nation in terms of per capita GDP growth, and the United Kingdom, a de-industrialising nation.
The four original variables are plotted in \cref{fig:data_plots} (in \cref{sec:graph_appendix}); we include the addition measure of energy intensity for India and the UK, but it is not available for Bangladesh.
Energy intensity, per-capita GDP, and number of patents are plotted on a logarithmic scale.
Trade openness and industrial share are fractions, and plotted on a linear scale; applying a logistic transformation yields a visually indistinguishable result, as neither of these variables are at the extremes of their ranges.
The correlation structures of the data are plotted in \cref{fig:log_correlations}; distributions and scatter plots can be found in \cref{fig:log_scatterplot}.

We can note some stylised facts about the data from these figures and their descriptive statistics:
\begin{itemize}

\item All three countries have positive growth over the period (though UK growth appears to stall  after the Global Financial Crisis)
\item Bangladesh is industrialising, the United Kingdom is de-industrialising, and India has a roughly constant level of industrialisation over the period
\item While India and the UK have a roughly similar levels of technological innovation if averaged over the period, India's is increasing, while the UK's is (if anything) falling.
\item Energy intensity is falling through time across all three of these countries, regardless of the direction of the other variables.
\item The scales of the data sometimes differ by orders of magnitude between countries, so pooling data would require additional transformation.
\item The data series with \$US scaling are significantly more volatile than the PPP-adjusted \$US-scaled series, suggesting that EIb and P\_GDPb may be less noisy measures; noting that the energy use measure is the same between EI and EIb, but that the correlation between EIb and P\_GDPb is weaker than that between EI and P\_GDP, we conclude that part of the covariance between EI and P\_GDP may be driven by exchange rate fluctuations.
\end{itemize}
It is clear to the naked eye that these series are non-stationary.
Testing for a unit-root with an ADF test (with constant and trend) yields the test statistic and p-values in \cref{tab:adf_log}; we cannot reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in most series.

This is unsurprising, and so we follow standard procedure in taking the first difference of these series, running the ADF test again to obtain the results in \cref{tab:adf_logdiff}: now we can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in nearly all of the series.
The correlation structures of the (log-differenced) data are plotted in \cref{fig:logdiff_correlations}; distributions and scatter plots can be found in \cref{fig:logdiff_scatterplot}.
The distributions are better behaved, and appear much closer to normality.
\cref{tab:normality_test} shows the results of a Jarque-Bera test, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality in most cases.

The most striking fact about the log differenced data is that most of the correlation structure is no longer significant, suggesting the possibility that the previous results were the result of spurious regression between I(1) series.

\section{Revised Model}\label{sec:revised_model}

To test this theory, we run the model on the data for Bangladesh with the following modifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The most recent vintage of the data is used
\item EI and P\_GDP are replaced with EIb and P\_GDPb, the PPP-adjusted versions
\item Since EIb and P\_GDPb are only available from 1990 onwards, the regression is run on 1990-2015 (with the missing EIb data in 2015 imputed via EM, as before)
\item We take the log difference of variables with unit levels (TI, EIb, P\_GDPb); we take the difference of unitless ratios (ISG, TO) as above. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Maybe.
