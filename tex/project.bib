Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health.},

  abstract = {This study investigates whether the effect of energy consumption on economic growth differs by the level of energy intensity. We employ an advanced dynamic panel threshold regression model to test for the ``threshold'' level of energy intensity that has an asymmetrical energy consumption effect on economic growth; we consider 12 Commonwealth of Independent States countries over the period 1991\textendash 2013. The estimated panel threshold regression model suggests 0.44\% as the threshold level of energy intensity. Energy consumption above this level significantly retards economic growth, whereas energy consumption below the level is found to have a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth. Thus, when the threshold level of energy intensity (one of the important indicators of energy efficiency) is exceeded, energy consumption significantly hinders growth. If policy makers pay more attention to energy intensity while formulating new energy policies, substantial gains can be achieved in low energy intensity environments.},

  abstract = {Our goal in this chapter is to complement earlier publications on reporting structural equation modeling results by offering guidance on five specific model types. We begin with item factor analysis, the modeling of latent variables with noncontinuous indicators. Coverage of this model type provides a basis for some general comments about reporting SEM results and sets the stage for coverage of measurement invariance. To these two model types, we add latent variable interaction, latent growth curve analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, as applied to SEM. For each of these model types there have been significant improvements in our ability to model data generated by sophisticated research designs and measurement strategies that align closely with complex research questions. Analysis of these model types generates more results and, in some cases, results that are not generated by analyses of more basic models. As such, the production of a satisfactory research report poses unique challenges.

For each model type, we begin with a brief description of the prototypic form of the model, including citations to general treatments of such models. We then discuss the analytic issues associated with the model type, offering practical suggestions for describing these issues and how they are addressed in research reports. Although our focus is not analysis strategy, we nonetheless point out important considerations and occasionally offer recommendations about analyses associated with the different model types. Next, we discuss the presentation of results, focusing specifically on information beyond what might typically be presented in an SEM research report. We conclude each section with a brief presentation of published examples that illustrate good reporting practice for the model type in question.},

The analysis has revealed the persistent decreasing trend in energy intensity across all the macro-regions and most countries, showing diversity of its course regarding both the starting point and rate of energy intensity reduction. Based on the time series, it has been shown that energy intensity of an economy is best described by an exponential trend, indicating a fairly uniform decline in energy efficiency in the economies. A power index of the exponential equation is one of the critical parameters characterizing reduction rate of energy intensity\textemdash the index of energy intensity reduction (IEIR). The authors have proposed an approach to measuring beta-convergence in time series of energy intensity, substantiating thereby convergence of economies. A comprehensive analysis of the time series and trend model served as a basis for prediction of variation in energy intensity of economies of the macro-regions for the period until 2040, which also included its quality and rationale verification. It has been shown that the trend method can be successfully applied to forecasting energy intensity developments to economically developed regions, whereas for developing countries such a forecast is less reliable. In these conditions, a comprehensive use of the trend model and the convergence model is necessary. The forecast of changes in energy intensity of the world economies grouped into macro-regions until 2040 has shown that the economically developed countries of Europe will remain to be the energy efficiency leaders until the mid-twenty-first century. The energy intensity indicators for less developed regions will gradually converge in their domain; yet, they are not expected to reach the level of the economically developed countries by 2040.},

However, the effects that the crude measure captures remain ambiguous, making it difficult to interpret the empirical results. Drawing on several strands of the literature, this study examines the informational content of the trade openness measure using intranational and international data. We find that, even for fully integrated economies within a country, trade openness is approximately half as variable as it is for segmented diverse countries around the world. The information it conveys is better characterized as the extent of the economic remoteness and idiosyncratic distribution of sectoral production. The cross-country variation of trade openness derives more from the variability in GDP than trade.},

This paper tests the hypothesis that the increase of German and British energy intensity was an effect from the concentration of heavy industrial production to these countries, although the consumption of a significant share of these goods took place elsewhere. We use an entirely new database that we have constructed (TEG: Trade, Energy, Growth) to test whether these countries exported more energy-demanding goods than they imported, thus providing other countries with means to industrialize and to consume cheap-energy demanding goods. We find that the U-shape curve is greatly diminished but does not disappear. The pronounced inverted U-curve in German energy intensity without trade adjustments is reduced when we account for energy embodied in the traded commodities. For Britain the shape of the curve is also flattened during the second half of the 19th century, before falling from WWI onwards. These consumption-based accounts are strongly influenced by the trade in metal goods and fuels, facilitating industrialization elsewhere.},

  abstract = {When a statistically significant mean difference is found, the magnitude of the difference is judged qualitatively using an effect size such as Cohen's d. In contrast, in a structural equation model (SEM), the result of the statistical test of model fit is often disregarded if significant, and inferences are drawn using "close" models retained based on point estimates of sample statistics (goodness-of-fit indices). However, when a SEM cannot be retained using a test of exact fit, all substantive inferences drawn from it are suspect. It is therefore important to determine the size of the model misfit. Standardized residual covariances and residual correlations provide standardized effect sizes of the misfit of SEM models. They can be summarized using the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMSR) and the Correlation Root Mean Squared Residual (CRMSR) which can be used as overall effect sizes of the misfit. Statistical theory is provided that allows the construction of confidence intervals and tests of close fit based on the SRMSR and CRMSR. It is hoped that the use of standardized effect sizes of misfit will help reconcile current practices in SEM and elsewhere in statistics.},

The results corroborate that industrialization has a direct positive influence on energy intensity where trade openness shows a direct negative effect on it; and both industrialization and trade openness have negative indirect impact on energy intensity through technological innovation and economic growth respectively. In case of individual total impacts, only industrialization affects energy intensity positively, where trade openness, technological innovation and economic growth negatively do. Based on the empirical results, some policy implications regarding energy intensity and effects of its factors on it are also presented.},
