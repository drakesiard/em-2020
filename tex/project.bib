Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health.},

We develop a theoretical model to divide trade's impact on pollution into scale, technique, and composition effects and then examine this theory using data on sulfur dioxide concentrations. We find international trade creates relatively small changes in pollution concentrations when it alters the composition of national output. Estimates of the trade-induced technique and scale effects imply a net reduction in pollution from these sources. Combining our estimates of all three effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion: freer trade appears to be good for the environment.},

We employ an advanced dynamic panel threshold regression model to test for the ``threshold'' level of energy intensity that has an asymmetrical energy consumption effect on economic growth; we consider 12 Commonwealth of Independent States countries over the period 1991\textendash 2013. The estimated panel threshold regression model suggests 0.44\% as the threshold level of energy intensity. Energy consumption above this level significantly retards economic growth, whereas energy consumption below the level is found to have a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth. Thus, when the threshold level of energy intensity (one of the important indicators of energy efficiency) is exceeded, energy consumption significantly hinders growth. If policy makers pay more attention to energy intensity while formulating new energy policies, substantial gains can be achieved in low energy intensity environments.},

  abstract = {Our goal in this chapter is to complement earlier publications on reporting structural equation modeling results by offering guidance on five specific model types. We begin with item factor analysis, the modeling of latent variables with noncontinuous indicators. Coverage of this model type provides a basis for some general comments about reporting SEM results and sets the stage for coverage of measurement invariance. To these two model types, we add latent variable interaction, latent growth curve analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, as applied to SEM. For each of these model types there have been significant improvements in our ability to model data generated by sophisticated research designs and measurement strategies that align closely with complex research questions. Analysis of these model types generates more results and, in some cases, results that are not generated by analyses of more basic models. As such, the production of a satisfactory research report poses unique challenges. For each model type, we begin with a brief description of the prototypic form of the model, including citations to general treatments of such models. We then discuss the analytic issues associated with the model type, offering practical suggestions for describing these issues and how they are addressed in research reports. Although our focus is not analysis strategy, we nonetheless point out important considerations and occasionally offer recommendations about analyses associated with the different model types. Next, we discuss the presentation of results, focusing specifically on information beyond what might typically be presented in an SEM research report. We conclude each section with a brief presentation of published examples that illustrate good reporting practice for the model type in question.},

  abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship between different pollutants and per capita income, i.e., environmental pressure increases up to a certain level as income goes up; after that, it decreases. An EKC actually reveals how a technically specified measurement of environmental quality changes as the fortunes of a country change. A sizeable literature on EKC has grown in recent period. The common point of all the studies is the assertion that the environmental quality deteriorates at the early stages of economic development/growth and subsequently improves at the later stages. In other words, environmental pressure increases faster than income at early stages of development and slows down relative to GDP growth at higher income levels. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with EKC phenomenon. Possible explanations for this EKC are seen in (i) the progress of economic development, from clean agrarian economy to polluting industrial economy to clean service economy; (ii) tendency of people with higher income having higher preference for environmental quality, etc. Evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned from several corners. Only some air quality indicators, especially local pollutants, show the evidence of an EKC. However, an EKC is empirically observed, till there is no agreement in the literature on the income level at which environmental degradation starts declining. This paper provides an overview of the EKC literature, background history, conceptual insights, policy and the conceptual and methodological critique.},

We compare the performance of standard panel estimators with that of our own two-step method (the AMG) and the Pesaran (2006) Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimators in time-series panels with arguably similar characteristics to those encountered in empirical applications using cross-country macro data. The empirical model adopted leads to an identification problem in standard estimation approaches in the case where the same unobserved common factors drive the evolution of both dependent and independent variables. We replicate the design of two recent Monte Carlo studies on the topic (Coakley et al, 2006; Kapetanios et al, 2009), with results confirming that the Pesaran (2006) CCE approach as well as our own AMG estimator solve this identification problem by accounting for the unobserved common factors in the regression equation. Our investigation however also indicates that simple augmentation with year dummies can do away with most of the bias in standard pooled estimators reported --- a finding which is in stark contrast to the results from earlier empirical work we carried out using cross-country panel data for agriculture and manufacturing (Eberhardt \& Teal, 2008; Eberhardt \& Teal, 2009). We therefore introduce a number of additional Monte Carlo setups which lead to greater discrepancy in the results between standard (micro-)panel estimators and the novel approaches incorporating cross-section dependence. We further highlight the performance of the pooled OLS estimator with variables in first differences and speculate about the reasons for its favourable results.},

The analysis has revealed the persistent decreasing trend in energy intensity across all the macro-regions and most countries, showing diversity of its course regarding both the starting point and rate of energy intensity reduction. Based on the time series, it has been shown that energy intensity of an economy is best described by an exponential trend, indicating a fairly uniform decline in energy efficiency in the economies. A power index of the exponential equation is one of the critical parameters characterizing reduction rate of energy intensity\textemdash the index of energy intensity reduction (IEIR). The authors have proposed an approach to measuring beta-convergence in time series of energy intensity, substantiating thereby convergence of economies. A comprehensive analysis of the time series and trend model served as a basis for prediction of variation in energy intensity of economies of the macro-regions for the period until 2040, which also included its quality and rationale verification. It has been shown that the trend method can be successfully applied to forecasting energy intensity developments to economically developed regions, whereas for developing countries such a forecast is less reliable. In these conditions, a comprehensive use of the trend model and the convergence model is necessary. The forecast of changes in energy intensity of the world economies grouped into macro-regions until 2040 has shown that the economically developed countries of Europe will remain to be the energy efficiency leaders until the mid-twenty-first century. The energy intensity indicators for less developed regions will gradually converge in their domain; yet, they are not expected to reach the level of the economically developed countries by 2040.},

The results show that indigenous R\&D plays a crucial and dominant role in the declining energy intensity among the four technological factors. In addition, technology spillovers coming from the openness of foreign direct investment and import decrease energy intensity except for the export. However, further estimation with the panel threshold model confirms that the effects of technology spillovers on energy intensity depend on the levels of local inputs of R\&D expenditure intensity and the full-time equivalent of R\&D personnel, allowing us to formulate different policies and measures aimed at encouraging more efficient use of energy that takes into full consideration the characteristics and situations of the technology spillovers.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that there is an inverted U-shape curve for energy intensity in the long-run for Western Europe with a peak in the early 20th century. This paper tests the hypothesis that the increase of German and British energy intensity was an effect from the concentration of heavy industrial production to these countries, although the consumption of a significant share of these goods took place elsewhere. We use an entirely new database that we have constructed (TEG: Trade, Energy, Growth) to test whether these countries exported more energy-demanding goods than they imported, thus providing other countries with means to industrialize and to consume cheap-energy demanding goods. We find that the U-shape curve is greatly diminished but does not disappear. The pronounced inverted U-curve in German energy intensity without trade adjustments is reduced when we account for energy embodied in the traded commodities. For Britain the shape of the curve is also flattened during the second half of the 19th century, before falling from WWI onwards. These consumption-based accounts are strongly influenced by the trade in metal goods and fuels, facilitating industrialization elsewhere.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a nonlinear panel data model which can endogenously generate both `weak' and `strong' cross-sectional dependence. The model's distinguishing characteristic is that a given agent's behaviour is influenced by an aggregation of the views or actions of those around them. The model allows for considerable flexibility in terms of the genesis of this herding or clustering type behaviour. At an econometric level, the model is shown to nest various extant dynamic panel data models. These include panel AR models, spatial models, which accommodate weak dependence only, and panel models where cross-sectional averages or factors exogenously generate strong, but not weak, cross sectional dependence. An important implication is that the appropriate model for the aggregate~series becomes intrinsically nonlinear, due to the clustering behaviour, and thus requires the disaggregates to be simultaneously considered with the aggregate. We provide the associated asymptotic theory for estimation and inference. This is supplemented with Monte Carlo studies and two empirical applications which indicate the utility of our proposed model as a vehicle to model different types of cross-sectional dependence.},

The main results provide evidence supporting the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between environment and income for the sampled countries.

As for the long-run causal relationship, the results indicate that estimated coefficients of lagged error correction term in the carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, GDP, and trade openness equations are statistically significant, implying that these four variables could play an important role in adjustment process as the system departs from the long-run equilibrium.},

The results demonstrate that the economic growth and trade openness have a positive effect on energy consumption, while the financial openness exerts a negative effect.

Moreover, it is necessary more liberalization and deregulation policies that incentive the trade and economy liberalization with the intention of bring more investments in energy efficiency technologies, and access to products with high energy efficiency that reduces the consumption of energy from fossil fuels and the environmental degradation.},

Using cointegration technique, the study finds evidence of long-run relationship between innovation and per capita economic growth in most of the cases, typically with reference to the use of a particular innovation indicator. Using Granger causality test, the study finds the presence of both unidirectional and bidirectional causality between innovation and per capita economic growth. These results vary from country to country, depending upon the types of innovation indicators that we use in the empirical investigation process. Most importantly, the study finds that all these innovation indicators are considerably linked with per capita economic growth. This particular linkage is either supply-leading or demand-following in some occasions, while it is the occurrence of both in some other occasions. The policy implication of this study is that countries should recognize the differences in innovation and per capita economic growth in order to maintain sustainable development in these countries.},

  abstract = {When a statistically significant mean difference is found, the magnitude of the difference is judged qualitatively using an effect size such as Cohen's d. In contrast, in a structural equation model (SEM), the result of the statistical test of model fit is often disregarded if significant, and inferences are drawn using "close" models retained based on point estimates of sample statistics (goodness-of-fit indices). However, when a SEM cannot be retained using a test of exact fit, all substantive inferences drawn from it are suspect. It is therefore important to determine the size of the model misfit. Standardized residual covariances and residual correlations provide standardized effect sizes of the misfit of SEM models. They can be summarized using the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMSR) and the Correlation Root Mean Squared Residual (CRMSR) which can be used as overall effect sizes of the misfit. Statistical theory is provided that allows the construction of confidence intervals and tests of close fit based on the SRMSR and CRMSR. It is hoped that the use of standardized effect sizes of misfit will help reconcile current practices in SEM and elsewhere in statistics.},

The general assumption of the model is that anthropogenic environmental impacts are a multiplicative function of population, affluence, and technology. While previous STIRPAT research has examined the impact of technology in terms of urbanization, estimating the specific effect of urban population, we argue that this measure is better understood as a proxy for modernization. As an alternative, we frame urbanization as a multidimensional driver of environmental change, and we operationalize the technology dimension through cross-national data on impervious surface area, or what we call `terrestrial technology'. To demonstrate the potential of this example for environmental sociology, we draw from political economy to show how operationalizing technology offers a stronger, more nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic drivers of environmental degradation. Analytically, we employ a spatial regression model that estimates the effect of terrestrial technology on total carbon emissions for 173 countries. Our results show that impervious surface area is positively related to total carbon output and thus should be considered an operational measure of technology in future STIRPAT analyses.},

The results corroborate that industrialization has a direct positive influence on energy intensity where trade openness shows a direct negative effect on it; and both industrialization and trade openness have negative indirect impact on energy intensity through technological innovation and economic growth respectively. In case of individual total impacts, only industrialization affects energy intensity positively, where trade openness, technological innovation and economic growth negatively do.

The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.},

These variables are statistically significant in all 36 baseline empirical models. The second set of results consists of quite robust findings relating to insignificant influence of foreign direct investment and negative influence of coal price. According to the results, it cannot be confirm the hypothesis of energy-saving technology transfer via foreign direct investments in European Union member states. The third set of results shows that the research has failed to generate any robust findings for economic openness (import ratio), urbanization and natural gas price, which means that the effect of these determinants on energy intensity in European Union member states is unspecified. Finally, auxiliary regressions estimation results show that changes in the sectorial composition within the European Union member states' economies have not enhanced energy-saving technological transfer via foreign direct investments.},

  abstract = {The difference and system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators are growing in popularity. As implemented in popular software, the estimators easily generate instruments that are numerous and, in system GMM, potentially suspect. A large instrument collection overfits endogenous variables even as it weakens the Hansen test of the instruments' joint validity. This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of instrument proliferation, and describes and simulates simple ways to control it. It illustrates the dangers by replicating Forbes [American Economic Review (2000) Vol. 90, pp. 869\textendash 887] on income inequality and Levine et al. [Journal of Monetary Economics] (2000) Vol. 46, pp. 31\textendash 77] on financial sector development. Results in both papers appear driven by previously undetected endogeneity.},

  abstract = {The theories of ecological modernization and urban environmental transition both recognize that urbanization can have positive and negative impacts on the natural environment with the net effect being hard to determine a priori. This study uses recently developed panel regression techniques that allow for heterogeneous slope coefficients and cross-section dependence to model the impact that urbanization has on CO2 emissions for a panel of emerging economies. The estimated contemporaneous coefficients on the energy intensity and affluence variables are positive, statistically significant and fairly similar across different estimation techniques. By comparison, the estimated contemporaneous coefficient on the urbanization variable is sensitive to the estimation technique. In most specifications, the estimated coefficient on the urbanization variable is positive but statistically insignificant. The implications of these results for sustainable development policy are discussed.},

The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration was applied to examine long run relationship among the series while stationarity properties of the variables was tested by applying structural break test. Our empirical evidence confirmed long run relationship among the variables. The results showed that energy use, financial development, capital, exports, imports and international trade have positive impact on economic growth. The Granger causality analysis revealed that unidirectional causal relationship running from energy use to economic growth. Financial development and energy use Granger cause each other. There is bidirectional causality between international trade and energy use. The feedback relation exists between financial development and international trade. There is also bidirectional causality exists between capital and energy demand, financial development and economic growth and, international trade and economic growth. This paper makes significant contribution in energy economics and opens up new direction for policy makers to explore new and alternative sources of energy which would be helpful in meeting the rising demand of energy due to sustained rate of economic growth.},

This study suggests a composite trade share measure that more completely reflects reality by combining two important dimensions of trade openness: trade share and the relative importance of a country's trade level to total world trade. Robustness tests support the new proposed measure in lieu of the conventional measure of openness and suggest that the latter may not only be incomplete but may also overstate the impact of trade on such things as income and the environment.},

Index Decomposition Analysis and Production Decomposition Analysis methods are combined to complete the decomposition analysis. Overall, seven factors are related to the decline in the energy intensity and technology improvement effect is the most significant factor. Technical efficiency effect is positively related to the decline in twelve provinces but negatively related in seventeen provinces. Capital-energy substitution effect is beneficial to the decline in twenty provinces. Labor-energy substitution effect undermines the decline and substitution effect among different categories of energy can be ignored. Considering provincial contribution, only Xinjiang Province has a negative contribution. Liaoning, Hebei and Shanghai provinces make the largest contributions to the decline in energy intensity. The main policy implications include enhancing investments in research and development in China's energy intensive industries; transforming the intensive development model of the energy intensive industries; gradually reforming energy price; and improving the layout of energy intensive industries.},

We were motivated by the fact that there is no study has investigated simultaneously these linkages through the use of the simultaneous equations models approach. Our empirical highlights for the high-income countries pointed out the presence of feedback causality between energy consumption and income and between trade openness and income. However, the findings support the occurrence of unidirectional causality running from trade openness to energy consumption without any feedback effects. In the case of middle-income countries, we recorded also the occurrence of feedback relationships between energy consumption and income and between trade openness and income, and a unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to trade. These empirical insights are of particular interest to policymakers as they help build sound economic policies to sustain economic development.},
