  abstract = {The paper presents retrospective developments of energy intensity of the world economy differentiated by regions and their levels of economic development. The analysis has revealed the persistent decreasing trend in energy intensity across all the macro-regions and most countries, showing diversity of its course regarding both the starting point and rate of energy intensity reduction. Based on the time series, it has been shown that energy intensity of an economy is best described by an exponential trend, indicating a fairly uniform decline in energy efficiency in the economies. A power index of the exponential equation is one of the critical parameters characterizing reduction rate of energy intensity\textemdash{}the index of energy intensity reduction (IEIR). The authors have proposed an approach to measuring beta-convergence in time series of energy intensity, substantiating thereby convergence of economies. A comprehensive analysis of the time series and trend model served as a basis for prediction of variation in energy intensity of economies of the macro-regions for the period until 2040, which also included its quality and rationale verification. It has been shown that the trend method can be successfully applied to forecasting energy intensity developments to economically developed regions, whereas for developing countries such a forecast is less reliable. In these conditions, a comprehensive use of the trend model and the convergence model is necessary. The forecast of changes in energy intensity of the world economies grouped into macro-regions until 2040 has shown that the economically developed countries of Europe will remain to be the energy efficiency leaders until the mid-twenty-first century. The energy intensity indicators for less developed regions will gradually converge in their domain; yet, they are not expected to reach the level of the economically developed countries by 2040.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that there is an inverted U-shape curve for energy intensity in the long-run for Western Europe with a peak in the early 20th century. This paper tests the hypothesis that the increase of German and British energy intensity was an effect from the concentration of heavy industrial production to these countries, although the consumption of a significant share of these goods took place elsewhere. We use an entirely new database that we have constructed (TEG: Trade, Energy, Growth) to test whether these countries exported more energy-demanding goods than they imported, thus providing other countries with means to industrialize and to consume cheap-energy demanding goods. We find that the U-shape curve is greatly diminished but does not disappear. The pronounced inverted U-curve in German energy intensity without trade adjustments is reduced when we account for energy embodied in the traded commodities. For Britain the shape of the curve is also flattened during the second half of the 19th century, before falling from WWI onwards. These consumption-based accounts are strongly influenced by the trade in metal goods and fuels, facilitating industrialization elsewhere.},

  abstract = {When a statistically significant mean difference is found, the magnitude of the difference is judged qualitatively using an effect size such as Cohen's d. In contrast, in a structural equation model (SEM), the result of the statistical test of model fit is often disregarded if significant, and inferences are drawn using "close" models retained based on point estimates of sample statistics (goodness-of-fit indices). However, when a SEM cannot be retained using a test of exact fit, all substantive inferences drawn from it are suspect. It is therefore important to determine the size of the model misfit. Standardized residual covariances and residual correlations provide standardized effect sizes of the misfit of SEM models. They can be summarized using the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMSR) and the Correlation Root Mean Squared Residual (CRMSR) which can be used as overall effect sizes of the misfit. Statistical theory is provided that allows the construction of confidence intervals and tests of close fit based on the SRMSR and CRMSR. It is hoped that the use of standardized effect sizes of misfit will help reconcile current practices in SEM and elsewhere in statistics.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, multifaceted interdependence between macroeconomic variables results in an extended list of factors that have diverse impacts on energy intensity. Thus, sustaining energy intensity at a desired level demands advanced studies to investigate the multifarious influences of its factors and ensure proactive measures to deal with them. This paper aims to set up a path model to analyze the direct and indirect impacts of industrialization and trade openness on energy intensity in Bangladesh. The results corroborate that industrialization has a direct positive influence on energy intensity where trade openness shows a direct negative effect on it; and both industrialization and trade openness have negative indirect impact on energy intensity through technological innovation and economic growth respectively. In case of individual total impacts, only industrialization affects energy intensity positively, where trade openness, technological innovation and economic growth negatively do. Based on the empirical results, some policy implications regarding energy intensity and effects of its factors on it are also presented.},
